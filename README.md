# SanBot
SanBot is a multipurpose discord bot written in python with discord.py for my personal use on my server(s).

## Usage & Setup
SanBot requires python3 and the discord.py library to be installed. \
### Admin users
Include the user IDs of any admin level users within the admin.txt file. Each ID should be on a new line.
### Discord Token
Include the client token (retrieved by creating a bot in the Discord Developers Panel) within the token.txt file.

## Features
### Usercensorship
`!censor @user [duration] [unit of time (seconds, minutes, hours)]`\
`!uncensor @user`\
Upon censorship, users' messages will be instantly deleted for the duration of time specified. Upon uncensorship, users will be cleared to talk again.

## Note
I wrote SanBot for my personal use on my private servers. Your satisfaction level with its features and source code may vary. More features are planned. I'll tidy the code sooner or later.
